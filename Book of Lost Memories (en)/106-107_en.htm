                  The Silent Hill series has come to reference many literary works in 
                  the form of motifs in the solutions to riddles. However, these 
                  references are not limited to mere citations. The subjects and world 
                  views of the original works have important meanings and suggestions

                  The otherworld in the first game is a world manifested from the

                  solutions to riddles that originate from works like Alice in 
                  Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz appear is that these are Alessa's 
                  favorite books from her childhood. In other words, they indicate 
                  that the otherworld itself is produced by Alessa. Similarly, an 
                  illustration from The Lost World, which is one of her favorite 
                  books, is used as a motif for one of the creatures that appears in

                    have been adapted all over the world and have become motifs in 
                    many works, and the sorrow that these tragic works hold has a
