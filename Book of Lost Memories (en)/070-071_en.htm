            Footnote:</b> The lyrics in Silent Hill 3 were made to fit 
              the songs from the original Japanese verses and produced with the English 
              translation. The Japanese is written strictly in poetic verse, and the English 
              translation isn't exact in quite a few sections because it was fitted to the 
              music and converted to English.
