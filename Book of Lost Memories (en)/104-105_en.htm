                      revival of God, and where in the second game James attempted to resurrect 
                      his deceased wife. It is a town that has an indigenous belief system that 
                      has been passed down over the years. With the appearance of nothing but 
                      unearthly rituals and fanatical priests over the course of the series, 
                      players have never clearly seen the true essence of the town's religion. 
                      Exactly what is the nature of the faith that originates from the town's 
                      former inhabitants?<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the history of this area which was revered as sacred 
                      ground and the doctrine which became the foundation for this faith, let us 
                      arrange a delineation of the relevant documents and dialogue from the 
                      series.

                  The religion of Silent Hill references various elements of different 
                  religions such as the origins of Christianity, Japanese folklore, 
                  and Aztec rituals. Original Native American beliefs have to do with 
                  animals and spirits that dwell in places, and borrowing their power 
                  to make oneself stronger. The names of the gods have Mayan and Aztec 
                  motifs. Using the strange pronunciations as a reference, I thought 
                  up original ones.<br />

                    conducted on this land became a model for the present-day cult 
                    faith. It is important to note, however, that the native religion is 
                    not the same thing as the cult. Think of them as being like Japan's

                  &nbsp;&nbsp; The basis for what the cult believes is derived from a myth 
                  that has been passed down over the years. In summary, &quot;Once, God set 
                  out to create paradise and Her power ran out, but someday God would 
                  be resurrected once again. The doors to paradise would be opened, 
                  and everyone would be saved.&quot; One detail unique to this religion is 
                  the idea that during the dawn of humanity, there was only suffering 
                  and hatred. It would seem that this has become a foundation for this 
                unique belief system. </td>

              &nbsp;&nbsp; The popular beliefs native to the region began to take shape as 
              a religion several decades ago. A rapid expansion took place over the course 
              of a few years that was the result of Vincent's achievements. It can be 
              surmised that Alessa, who was born around thirty years ago, was established 
              as a saint in the cult and thus the structure of the organization was only 
            recently put in order.</p>

                    In a church 
                      in the real world the adherents normally sit opposite the 
                      priest, however in the otherworld's final church the priest is 
                      encircled by the adherents. It calls to mind not praying to God, 
                      but everyone in attendance watching a ceremony taking place in 
                      the central area, don't you think? The design has a motif 
                      inspired by British Parliament.<br />
