            on the development of the game.</p>
<p><b class="a073red"> Hiroyuki Owaku:</b> We finished working on our previous project on the ps2 in August of 
              2001, and then in October we were hard at work on Restless Dreams. We 
            began working on Silent Hill 3 immediately after that.</p>
            <p><b class="a073red">Q:</b> It looks like you rarely saw any vacation time. Was this painful for 
              you? <br />
              <br />
              (everyone laughs)<br />
              <br />
              <b class="a073red">Masahiro Ito:</b> I felt that it was dispiriting at times, but then if you take a vacation whenever you feel like it, you'll lose your 
            job, so...</p>
            <p align="center" class="pages"><b> 073</b></p>
            <p align="left"> Owaku mentions that one 
              reason for starting the game someplace other than Silent Hill is so they 
              could include locations that wouldn't be found in a small countryside 
            town, such as an urban shopping center and subway.</p>
            <p align="center" class="pages"><b>  074</b></p>
            <p align="left">Ito says 
              that the use of visual noise in the game isn't constant-- it's very 
              slight at the beginning and increases as Heather gets closer to Silent 
              Hill.<br />
              <br />
              <b class="a073red">footnote #3:</b> In Silent Hill 2, noise was used to express James' delusions. In Silent 
                Hill 3, one reason there's very little noise in the early stages of the 
                game is that Heather hasn't yet recovered her memories.<br />
                <br />
                Owaku says that he wrote the scenario in Japanese and then Jeremy 
                Blaustein, the English supervisor, translated it into English. In order 
                to breathe life into the English version of the script, many small 
                revisions were made during the translation process.<br />
                <br />
                He also mentions that one of the reasons for choosing a main character 
                that was a girl is that he was getting bored with male protagonists. 
                Making the protagonist female gives players something new, and depicting 
                the storyline as well as fear and other emotions can take on new 
                aspects. And of course, a male protagonist can't be the mother of God.<br />
                <br />
                The reason for having only four central characters (five if you count 
                Leonard) is that the team had planned to keep the story relatively 
            simply from the beginning.</p>

            <p align="left">Shingo 
              Yuri says that the overall quality of the character designs benefited 
              from the fact that there were so few characters.<br />
              <br />
              <b class="a073red">footnote #8:</b> The development team made a point of including characteristics like 
                freckles, spots and moles for the character models.<br />
                <br />
                <b class="a073red">footnote #9:</b> Certain characteristics that members of the development team possess 
                  were also included to make the characters more realistic, such as an 
                  asymmetry between the left and right side of the face, Vincent's 
                  tendency to squint, and Douglas' hair thinning at the back of his head.<br />
                  <br />
                  Owaku mentions that he feels that the insertion of prerendered movies 
                  disrupt the flow of a game. Part of the reason for animating facial 
                  motion so meticulously was so that prerendered scenes would not be 
                  necessary.<br />
                  <br />
                  Yuri says that since certain things such as the movement of fingers and 
                  eyes can't be motion captured, video recordings of the voice actors were 
                  referenced while programming the facial animations for the characters 
            they voiced.</p>
            <p align="center" class="pages"><b>  076</b></p>
            <p align="left">Owaku says 
              that the nature of the horror in Silent Hill 3 is a bit different from 
              2. In Silent Hill 2, this aspect of the game sinks in quietly bit by 
              bit, while in 3 it's more vivid and intense. For example, the gap 
              between the &quot;right side&quot; world and the &quot;reverse side&quot; world is more 
              distinct.<br />
              <br />
              He also mentions that when he first saw the scene in which the office 
              building undergoes the shift to the otherworld, this was a point at 
              which he felt this game would be able to surpass Silent Hill 2 in some 
              respects.<br />
              <br />
              Norihito Hatakeda feels that it's ideal for events to take place in real 
              time. The shift to the otherworld that takes place in the office 
              building as well as the shift during the transition from the subway to 
              the sewers are both examples of this.<br />
              <br />
              Akira Yamaoka mentions that he'd had an interest in including songs with 
              vocal tracks for a while, but there was a question of finding a vocalist 
              with a quality in his or her voice that would be suited to the 
              atmosphere of Silent Hill. Most game music makes use of sounds that are 
              synthesized instead of using real instruments, and Yamaoka feels that 
              it's desirable to utilize the expressive power of the human voice.<br />
              <br />
              According to Owaku, the combat in Silent Hill 2 had not been 
              particularly well-received. The team was careful to include more enemies 
              in the third game so that players could enjoy devising strategies to 
              fight them.<br />
              <br />
              Yuki Mizuochi says that he had decided from the start to include more 
              enemies and weapons. He was also able to program more specialized 
            vibrations for the dual shock to correspond to each weapon.</p>

            <p align="left"> Asked whether he feels that 
              he has a complete grasp of what happens in the Silent Hill games, 
              Yamaoka says he wonders if anyone besides Owaku understands it all 
              completely, and also expresses his shock at having recently heard that 
              some of it is based in Freud's psychoanalytic theories.<br />
              <br />
              Hatakeda thinks that understanding it all might be impossible.<br />
              <br />
              Owaku says that there are things about Ito's designs that he doesn't 
              understand himself, and that he actually didn't understand Valtiel's 
              significance completely until data was being gathered for this book. Ito 
              says jokingly that he'll be sure to explain it to other people from now 
              on.<br />
              <br />
              Shingo Yuri jokes that when the book is released, he and other members 
              of the team will be reading it and saying &quot;Ah, I see...&quot;<br />
              <br />
              Hatakeda mentions that he created a certain effect with the images of 
              Alessa's burns, fire, and blood in mind, and asks the other members of 
              the development team what sort of understanding they have of it. Owaku 
              says that he has the same understanding of it as Hatakeda.<br />
              <br />
              <b class="a073red">footnote #19:</b> Hatakeda did all the effects that have to do with the real-time shifts 
                to the otherworld and the moving walls. This effect represents the 
            intense suffering that Alessa endured as a result of her burns.</p>
            <p align="center" class="pages"><b>  078</b></p>
            <p align="left"> Yamaoka is asked whether or 
              not there will be subsequent games in the series, to which he replies 
              that he simply doesn't know at this point.<br />
              <br />
              To the question, &quot;What would you like to do next?&quot; Shingo Yuri replies 
              that he would like to work on something that isn't a horror game. 
              Hatakeda says that he would like to do something along the lines of Half 
              Life 2, and suggests that it might be possible to do a game of this type 
              in the world of Silent Hill in which a different otherworld appears 
              before each player. Mizuochi says that he would like to do something 
              more colorful along the lines of a game about an American comic book 
              hero, since he feels that the fact that the protagonists in the Silent 
              Hill series are merely ordinary people is a bit restricting. Ito says 
              that he'd like to do a game with a science fiction theme. Owaku says 
              that he's always wanted to work on the kind of game that could affect or 
              change someone's life. He feels that there are novels and movies that 
              have had an impact on his own life, but hasn't yet had that sort of 
            experience with a game.</p>
            <p align="center" class="pages"><b>  079</b></p>
            <p align="left"> The interviewer suggests 
              that there are probably people for whom Silent Hill has had an impact 
              comparable to the impact that books and movies can have. He then asks 
              each member of the development team to say something to players in 
              closing.<br />
              <br />
              Owaku says he worked on Silent Hill 3 with the intention of giving 
              players something that would be fun and interesting as well as 
              frightening, so he'll be happy if he was able to achieve this.<br />
              <br />
              Ito says that he'd like aspiring game designers and art directors to 
              someday name Silent Hill 3 as having had an influence on them.<br />
              <br />
              Mizuochi suggests going for 100 stars and getting a perfect score.<br />
              <br />
              Instead of simply playing straight through the game, Hatakeda recommends 
              slowing down once in a while to look around, as there are discoveries to 
              be made.<br />
              <br />
              Yuri says not to be distracted by the cutscenes or subtitles and to look 
              closely at the characters. (Owaku says, &quot;Huh? The scenario...?)<br />
              <br />
              To anyone who is introduced to Silent Hill by the third game, Yamaoka 
              recommends playing the first two games in the series after finishing 
            Silent Hill 3.</p>
